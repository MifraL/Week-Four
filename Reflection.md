Recording 

-	Something small growing larger
-	“Mining the Dispatch”
-	 Tools to see the broad pattern and find why they exist 
-	Problems making arguments about these dialogues 

Reading 1: Arguing with Digital History working group, “Digital History and Argument,” white paper, Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media.

-	Brings together prominent historians to see what to watch out for (prof)
-	Digital history is already making arguments in forms that are different then the analog scholarship 
-	The field is an extension of what history can do and historians should recognize this…. And incorporate the components into the already existing forms
-	Digital historians address a wider audience than historians. Historians use digital sources but do not credit them … I did not know this happened in the academic field … it is shocking.
-	Recognizing digital sources would allow the bridge between the two fields to close
-	The disciplines both share similarities…. They use interpretations to create a narrative of the past 
-	Historians select sources
-	Basic contextualization compares sources from the same period, place or topic.
-	Scale to historians means advancing their claims within the context of a “specific scale of analysis.”
-	Historians communicate their ideas to chosen audience 
-	Keys aspects of historical thinking is holdings, metadata or interface. 
-	Each person in a collection has an identifier which can connect them to related information and digital collections contextualizes and synthesize these sources. 
-	Historians don’t use online publications because they are more likely to cite print publications but it is also hard to find related sources online without proper keywords. 
-	Acknowledge all contributors when using archival materials to make arguments. 
-	Non-linear narratives should be encouraged more as it can engage the public 
-	Digital history offers a platform for creating different forms of narrative across varying media rather than being a threat to historians use of narrative form. 
-	To achieve communicating knowledge effectively, the preservations of alternative forms of scholarship should be explored rather than be limited to prints. Prints should not define the narrative.
-	Historians should consult the origins of their sources (in terms of community input).
-	Methodology should be elaborate to accommodate different paths.
-	Historians should mention how they found and analyzed their sources. 
-	In digital history, sources are changed into data and reduced to a model to explain the past. Datasets should be used more often as it simplifies the process of research. 
-	Text analysis uses patterns of argumentation to group common topics.
-	Network analysis focuses on relationships whether they are people, place or things. 
-	Spatial analysis takes into consideration space and place (theory or statistical computation).
-	Most digital work take form of a visualization…. They can be multivariate. 
-	Usually historical argument does not ask readers to explore a body of sources as they select and frame evidence pertaining to their claims. Whereas interactive visualization can be embedded online. It can serve to extend the engagement with the discipline. 

Reading 2: Tim Hitchcock,‘Big Data for Dead People’ Historyonics.

-	It was talk about how new digital resources changed the way the past was read and the impact it has on humanities and history. 
-	New readings = new thinking???
-	Need to think harder about the nature of digital history
-	Concept of distant reading of text = it seems to tell us what we already know
-	The approach by Ben Schmidt’s analysis of the dialogue in “Mad Men.” He compares languages by the scriptwriters against text published by Google books in that year. It changes the characters of what is read by giving a standard to compare. 
-	“What surprises me most, is that I am not more surprised.” Really love this quote.
-	Sarah Durrant represents a different way of thinking. She found two bank notes on her coffee house and pocketed them. Her imprisonment has been recorded so there are trails left behind whether as text or image. Her experience can then be compared to other women with the same class and age. We can also know that she had to face a new system of policing. Although she wanted a plea bargain, it was refused. Close reading can be done much deeper now. 
-	Each of these readings, reinforce a larger story.
-	 “When everything is made digital, everything can be read in a new way.”
-	The “LIVE” project by the Royal Veterinary College allows for a full-scale haptic representation of a cow in labour. It is so realistic according to people that tried it. Reading can be different because it is digital it does not need be static. 
-	Innovation results in new discovery which creates new digital forms. 
-	Difference between big data approaches as opposed to culturomics is that there is no pretence to a specific model. It brings new ways of reading the past. 
-	History is not the past… 

Reading 3: Matthew Lincoln,‘Confabulation in the humanities’ blog.

-	Argues about whether we are learning anything new by using quantitative approaches to historical questions.
-	In his own research, where he explored the artistic print producers, he measured how certain network properties change over time. 
-	Example 1: helps see the shift of Dutch printmakers and their connections internationally rather than domestically. 
-	Example 2: shows the growth of domestic connections after the spike of internationals connections due to the economic growth as the result of international sea trade.
-	The data helps rationalize the narrative of history.
-	The author states how easy it is to rationalize the results based on observations and based on this it can be seen that there’s no definite answer.
