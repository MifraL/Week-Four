What is missing from historical argumentation in digital history? 

- I believe digital history is missing a methodology that is their own rather than a combination of other disciplines. 
- They also lack acknowledgement of their work. The lack of recognition limits the impact it could have in history.


What is different about this process from what you have come to experience as historians in other classes?

- The difference is the visualization. It is dynamic, I could look at detailed more closely. The idea of seeing patterns, I haven’t come across my other class. 
- Learning a lot of applications to help create the data... it could be tedious if you're not interested. Most of these applications require the use of coding so it is essential to know atleast the basics of programming which is not something that you will across in a typical history class.

How do the particular affordances of digital work change what you might know - and how you might argue it? 

- Before I used to use prints for my research but it has changed gradually throughout my years in the university. I’ve been using online publications more often as it is easier to access and there's no need to worry about damaging or returning the prints late... 

How much (or what) a priori knowledge is a requirement for digital history arguments to make sense to a reader/viewer/user?

- I believe prior knowledge is not needed to understand digital history arguments. 
-I did not have much of a background and I could still understand what the writer argued about because it is easier to search up words if you don't know and the platform are more interactive so the reader can ask questions straight to the author. Most of the readings, I have read in this class, I saw comment section and there was a lot of reply from the authors to questions. I though this is was remarquable and it might attract people to engage in more discussions.
