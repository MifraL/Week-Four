What is missing from historical argumentation in digital history? 

- It is a methodology that is their own (digital history) rather than a combination of other disciplines. 
- Acknowledgement of their work. The lack of recognition limits the impact it could have in history.

What is different about this process from what you have come to experience as historians in other classes?

- The difference is the visualization. It is dynamic, I could look at detailed more closely. The idea of seeing patterns, I haven’t come across my other class and it is essential I believe to recognize them in research 

How do the particular affordances of digital work change what you might know - and how you might argue it? 

- Before I used to use prints for my research but when I came to university, I’ve been using online publications more often. They still are not the preferred resources by some of my profs. 

How much (or what) a priori knowledge is a requirement for digital history arguments to make sense to a reader/viewer/user?

- I believe prior knowledge is not needed to understand digital history arguments. I did not have much of a background and I could still understand what the writer argued about.
