Excel and R:

Excel 
-	I tried saving by opening the tab, it canceled the file.
-	I tried saving it by right clicking it …
-	Went to site, then downloaded it there as a csv
-	The file after unzipping it has it already in excel 

R
-	It worked fine apart from having trouble opening the application = it usually happens to take a while

Voyant 

-	My page is a bit different; I assume the link is not the correct one
-	There is no spark line in the trend section 
-	https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=49f48aa297f23faaecb77e664a9f0650

- I took a break for a two days to try it again, but the site was not working. 
- with the new link provided by the prof @ https://service.sadilar.org/voyant/, it worked. 
- I realized the mistake was when I was choosing the option in the add text tab, I forget to change the documents to 'from cells in each row.'

- To create my own corpus, I copied the links as mentioned by the prof and followed the procedure

Antconc

-	I think I downloaded the wrong file
-	Im confused about which one to use
-	I followed the steps and the names in the corpus files don’t look the same
-	When I did the search for shot it came out weird 
-	Took a break 
-	Redid the steps from the link 
-	When I searched the, other similar words were also highlighted 
-	I wrote the wrong word = sort in the tab and clicked sort so I think that messed up the findings
-	When I copied it into notepad, the shot word was not aligned as well the text file
-	Before, I made a mistake yesterday when I was doing the last step and I realized where I went wrong, I forget to add the directory in the tool preferences, So the key words had an issue
-	I also opened the wrong file

Topic Modeling and R:

Topic modeling 
-	Issue with finding/choosing the correct directory for the input/output/metadata

With R
-	I had an error command
- I was done way earlier but I felt a bit embarassed to ask for help even though I was doing it before
-I realized the mistake would be obvious and it was. I was doing the programming again and realized I forgot to do the library(tidyverse) for some reason. 
- I wasted a lot of days trying to figure out, take a break and think... It could all have been prevented very easily.
- I realized for instructions, I tend to browse through fast and I miss a lot little things. Which results in me getting stuck. In my case, I can't blame the computer!!!
- It is something that I realize I have to change and learn to improve myself so that I can prevent it from happening again.

- There was an error because I ran the line for tidy_cb one by one... had to run them together
-I had an error saying that there was no package(tm). Followed the pinned message by prof to add install.packages("tm") and then library(tm).
- I had the same issue as Mychelle where there wa an error in LDA... so I added install.packages('topicmodels')
- @https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/312914/error-from-aggregate-function-from-the-r-package-sf for the Error in aggregate.data.frame(as.data.frame(x), ...) : arguments must have same length. It still does not work!!!
- I did check the source before and I though everything was fine and I restarted the code... the error was still there.
- Finally, I really dowloaded the cvs after deleting the one I had before and it worked this time. 
- I think one was the issue was I opened the file and enabled content before and that might have done something.

Bonus 

- I think the barcode is pleasing for purely visuals.
- The montage is good to see the evolution of the covers as they progess through a period of time.
- The plot, I'm confused as what it could tell...

Notes
- I forgot to save the notes.md and I had to restart... I forgot most of the things that I had written. 
- This week was frustrasting!!!
